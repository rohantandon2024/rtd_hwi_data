1,"Hawaii is a state in the Western United States, about 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the U.S. mainland in the Pacific Ocean. "
2,"It is the only U.S. state outside North America, the only state that is an archipelago, and the only state in the tropics."
3,"Hawaii comprises nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago, 137 volcanic islands spanning 1,500 miles (2,400 km) that are physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania. "
4,"The state's ocean coastline is consequently the fourth-longest in the U.S., at about 750 miles (1,210 km). "
5,"The eight main islands, from northwest to southeast, are Ni_ihau, Kaua_i, O_ahu, Moloka_i, L_na_i, Kaho_olawe, Maui, and Hawai_i the last of these, after which the state is named, is often called the ""Big Island"" or ""Hawaii Island"" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. "
6,"The uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands make up most of the Papah_naumoku_kea Marine National Monument, the United States' largest protected area and the fourth-largest in the world."
7,"Of the 50 U.S. states, Hawaii is the eighth-smallest in land area and the 11th-least populous, but with 1.4 million residents ranks 13th in population density. "
8,"Two-thirds of the population lives on O'ahu, home to the state's capital and largest city, Honolulu. "
9,"Hawaii is among the country's most diverse states, owing to its central location in the Pacific and over two centuries of migration. "
10,"As one of only six majority-minority states, it has the country's only Asian American plurality, its largest Buddhist community, and the largest proportion of multiracial people. "
11,"Consequently, it is a unique melting pot of North American and East Asian cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian heritage. "
12,"As of 2020, Hawaii has the longest life expectancy of any U.S. state, at 80.7 years."
13,"Settled by Polynesians some time between 1000 and 1200 CE, Hawaii was home to numerous independent chiefdoms. "
14,"In 1778, British explorer James Cook was the first known non-Polynesian to arrive at the archipelago; early British influence is reflected in the state flag, which bears a Union Jack. "
15,"An influx of European and American explorers, traders, and whalers soon arrived, leading to the decimation of the once isolated Indigenous community by introducing diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, smallpox, measles, leprosy, and typhoid fever, reducing the native Hawaiian population from between 300,000 and one million to less than 40,000 by 1890."
16,"Hawaii became a unified, internationally recognized kingdom in 1810, remaining independent until American and European businessmen overthrew the monarchy in 1893; this led to annexation by the U.S. in 1898. "
17,"As a strategically valuable U.S. territory, Hawaii was attacked by Japan on December 7, 1941, which brought it global and historical significance, and contributed to America's decisive entry into World War II. "
18,"Hawaii is the most recent state to join the union, on August 21, 1959. "
19,"In 1993, the U.S. government formally apologized for its role in the overthrow of Hawaii's government, which spurred the Hawaiian sovereignty movement."
20,"Historically dominated by a plantation economy, Hawaii remains a major agricultural exporter due to its fertile soil and uniquely tropical climate in the U.S. "
21,"Its economy has gradually diversified since the mid-20th century, with tourism and military defense becoming the two largest sectors. "
22,"The state attracts tourists, surfers, and scientists with its diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, active volcanoes, and clear skies on the Big Island. "
23,"Hawaii hosts the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the world's largest naval command, as well as 75,000 employees of the Defense Department."
24,"Although its relative isolation results in one of the highest costs of living in the United States, Hawaii is the third-wealthiest state."
25,"The State of Hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island, Hawai_i. "
26,"A common explanation of the name of Hawai_i is that it was named for Hawai_iloa, a legendary figure from Hawaiian myth. "
27,He is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled.
28,"The Hawaiian language word Hawai_i is very similar to Proto-Polynesian Sawaiki, with the reconstructed meaning ""homeland"". "
29,"Cognates of Hawai_i are found in other Polynesian languages, including M_ori (Hawaiki), Rarotongan (_Avaiki) and Samoan (Savai_i). "
30,"According to linguists Pukui and Elbert, ""elsewhere in Polynesia, Hawai_i or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home, but in Hawaii, the name has no meaning""."
31,"In 1978, Hawaiian was added to the Constitution of the State of Hawaii as an official state language alongside English."
32,The title of the state constitution is The Constitution of the State of Hawaii.
33,"Article XV, Section 1 of the Constitution uses The State of Hawaii."
34,"Diacritics were not used because the document, drafted in 1949, predates the use of the _okina ___ and the kahak_ in modern Hawaiian orthography. "
35,The exact spelling of the state's name in the Hawaiian language is Hawai_i.
36,"In the Hawaii Admission Act that granted Hawaiian statehood, the federal government recognized Hawaii as the official state name. "
37,"Official government publications, department and office titles, and the Seal of Hawaii use the traditional spelling with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length."
38,There are eight main Hawaiian islands. 
39,"Seven are inhabited, but only six are open to tourists and locals. "
40,Ni_ihau is privately managed by brothers Bruce and Keith Robinson; access is restricted to those who have their permission. 
41,This island is also home to native Hawaiians. 
42,Access to uninhabited Kaho_olawe island is also restricted and anyone who enters without permission will be arrested. 
43,This island may also be dangerous since it was a military base during the world wars and could still have unexploded ordnance.
44,"The Hawaiian archipelago is 2,000 mi (3,200 km) southwest of the contiguous United States."
45,[37] Hawaii is the southernmost U.S. state and the second westernmost after Alaska.
46,"Like Alaska, Hawaii borders no other U.S. state. "
47,"It is the only U.S. state not in North America, and the only one completely surrounded by water and entirely an archipelago."
48,"In addition to the eight main islands, the state has many smaller islands and islets."
49,Ka_ula is a small island near Ni_ihau. 
50,"The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands is a group of nine small, older islands northwest of Kaua_i that extends from Nihoa to Kure Atoll; these are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains. "
51,"Across the archipelago are around 130 small rocks and islets, such as Molokini, which are made up of either volcanic or marine sedimentary rock.[38]"
52,"Hawai_i's tallest mountain Mauna Kea is 13,796 ft (4,205 m) above mean sea level;[39] it is taller than Mount Everest if measured from the base of the mountain, which lies on the floor of the Pacific Ocean and rises about 33,500 feet (10,200 m).[40]"
53,The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called the Hawai_i hotspot. 
54,"The process is continuing to build islands; the tectonic plate beneath much of the Pacific Ocean continually moves northwest and the hotspot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes. "
55,"Because of the hotspot's location, all active land volcanoes are on the southern half of Hawai_i Island. "
56,"The newest volcano, Kama_ehuakanaloa (formerly L__ihi), is south of the coast of Hawai_i Island."
57,"The last volcanic eruption outside Hawai_i Island occurred at Haleakal_ on Maui before the late 18th century, possibly hundreds of years earlier.[41] "
58,"In 1790, K_lauea exploded; it was the deadliest eruption known to have occurred in the modern era in what is now the United States.[42] "
59,"Up to 5,405 warriors and their families marching on K_lauea were killed by the eruption.[43] "
60,Volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features.
61,Hawaii Island has the second-highest point among the world's islands.[44]
62,"On the volcanoes' flanks, slope instability has generated damaging earthquakes and related tsunamis, particularly in 1868 and 1975.[45] "
63,Catastrophic debris avalanches on the ocean island volcanoes' submerged flanks have created steep cliffs.[46][47]
64,"K_lauea erupted in May 2018, opening 22 fissure vents on its eastern rift zone. "
65,The Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens are within this territory. 
66,"The eruption destroyed at least 36 buildings and this, coupled with the lava flows and the sulfur dioxide fumes, necessitated the evacuation of more than 2,000 inhabitants from their neighborhoods.[48]"
67,"The islands of Hawai_i are distant from other land habitats, and life is thought to have arrived there by wind, waves (i.e., by ocean currents), and wings (i.e., birds, insects, and any seeds that they may have carried on their feathers). "
68,Hawai_i has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other U.S. state.[49] 
69,The endemic plant Brighamia now requires hand pollination because its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct.[50] 
70,The two species of Brighamia B. rockii and B. insignis are represented in the wild by around 120 individual plants. 
71,"To ensure that these plants set seed, biologists rappel down 3,000-foot (910 m) cliffs to brush pollen onto their stigmas.[51]"
72,"The archipelago's extant main islands have been above the surface of the ocean for less than 10 million years, a fraction of the time biological colonization and evolution have occurred there. "
73,The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field. 
74,Native Hawaiians developed complex horticultural practices to utilize the surrounding ecosystem for agriculture. 
75,"Cultural practices developed to enshrine values of environmental stewardship and reciprocity with the natural world, resulting in widespread biodiversity and intricate social and environmental relationships that persist to this day.[52] "
76,"On a single island, the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical (less than 20 inches or 510 millimeters annual rainfall) to wet tropical; on the slopes, environments range from tropical rainforest (more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimeters per year), through a temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold, dry climate."
77,"The rainy climate impacts soil development, which largely determines ground permeability, affecting the distribution of streams and wetlands.[53][54][55]"
78,Several areas in Hawai_i are under the National Park Service's protection.[56] 
79,"Hawaii has two national parks: Haleakal_ National Park, near Kula on Maui, which features the dormant volcano Haleakal_ that formed east Maui; and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, in the southeast region of Hawai_i Island, which includes the active volcano K_lauea and its rift zones."
80,"There are three national historical parks: Kalaupapa National Historical Park in Kalaupapa, Moloka_i, the site of a former leper colony; Kaloko-Honok_hau National Historical Park in Kailua-Kona on Hawai_i Island; and Pu_uhonua o H_naunau National Historical Park, an ancient place of refuge on Hawai_i Island's west coast. "
81,Other areas under the National Park Service's control include Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail on Hawai_i Island and the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor on O_ahu.
82,"President George W. Bush proclaimed the Papah_naumoku_kea Marine National Monument on June 15, 2006. "
83,"The monument covers roughly 140,000 square miles (360,000 km2) of reefs, atolls, and shallow and deep sea out to 50 miles (80 km) offshore in the Pacific Ocean an area larger than all the national parks in the U.S. combined.[57]"
84,Hawai_i has a tropical climate. 
85,Temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of near-constant trade winds from the east. 
86,"Summer highs reach around 88 F (31 C) during the day, with lows of 75 F (24 C) at night. "
87,Winter day temperatures are usually around 83 F (28 C); at low elevation they seldom dip below 65 F (18 C) at night. 
88,"Snow, not usually associated with the tropics, falls at 13,800 feet (4,200 m) on Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on Hawaii Island in some winter months. "
89,"Snow rarely falls on Haleakal_. Mount Wai_ale_ale on Kaua_i has the second-highest average annual rainfall on Earth, about 460 inches (12,000 mm) per year. "
90,Most of Hawaii experiences only two seasons; the dry season runs from May to October and the wet season is from October to April.[59]
91,"The warmest temperature recorded in the state, in Pahala on April 27, 1931, is 100 F (38 C), tied with Alaska as the lowest record high temperature observed in a U.S. state."
92,"[60] Hawai_i's record low temperature is 12 F (-11 C) observed in May 1979, on the summit of Mauna Kea. "
93,Hawai_i is the only state to have never recorded subzero Fahrenheit temperatures.
94,"Climates vary considerably on each island; they can be divided into windward and leeward (ko_olau and kona, respectively) areas based upon location relative to the higher mountains. Windward sides face cloud cover.[61]"
95,Hawaii has a decades-long history of hosting more military space for the United States than any other territory or state.[62] 
96,"This record of military activity has taken a sharp toll on the environmental health of the Hawaiian archipelago, degrading its beaches and soil, and making some places entirely unsafe due to unexploded ordnance.[63] "
97,"According to scholar Winona LaDuke: ""The vast militarization of Hawaii has profoundly damaged the land. "
98,"According to the Environmental Protection Agency, there are more federal hazardous waste sites in Hawaii 31 than in any other U.S. state.""[64] "
99,"Hawaii State Representative Roy Takumi writes in ""Challenging U.S. Militarism in Hawai'i and Okinawa"" that these military bases and hazardous waste sites have meant ""the confiscation of large tracts of land from native peoples"" and quotes late Hawaiian activist George Helm as asking: ""What is national defense when what is being destroyed is the very thing the military is entrusted to defend, the sacred land of Hawai_i?""[62] "
100,Contemporary Indigenous Hawaiians are still protesting the occupation of their homelands and environmental degradation due to increased militarization in the wake of 9/11.[65]
101,"After the rise of sugarcane plantations in the mid 19th century, island ecology changed dramatically. "
102,"Plantations require massive quantities of water, and European and American plantation owners transformed the land in order to access it, primarily by building tunnels to divert water from the mountains to the plantations, constructing reservoirs, and digging wells.[66] "
103,These changes have made lasting impacts on the land and continue to contribute to resource scarcity for Native Hawaiians today.[66][67]
104,"According to Stanford scientist and scholar Sibyl Diver, Indigenous Hawaiians engage in a reciprocal relationship with the land, ""based on principles of mutual caretaking, reciprocity and sharing"".[68] "
105,"This relationship ensures the longevity, sustainability, and natural cycles of growth and decay, as well as cultivating a sense of respect for the land and humility towards one's place in an ecosystem.[68]"
106,"The tourism industry's ongoing expansion and its pressure on local systems of ecology, cultural tradition and infrastructure is creating a conflict between economic and environmental health.[69] "
107,"In 2020, the Center for Biological Diversity reported on the plastic pollution of Hawaii's Kamilo beach, citing ""massive piles of plastic waste"".[70] "
108,"Invasive species are spreading, and chemical and pathogenic runoff is contaminating groundwater and coastal waters.[71]"
109,"After Europeans and mainland Americans first arrived during the Kingdom of Hawaii period, the overall population of Hawaii which until that time composed solely of Indigenous Hawaiians fell dramatically. "
110,"Many people of the Indigenous Hawaiian population died to foreign diseases, declining from 300,000 in the 1770s, to 60,000 in the 1850s, to 24,000 in 1920. "
111,"Other estimates for the pre contact population range from 150,000 to 1.5 million."
112,"[14] In 1923, 42% of the population was of Japanese descent, 9% was of Chinese descent, and 16% was native descent.[146] "
113,The population of Hawaii began to finally increase after an influx of primarily Asian settlers that arrived as migrant laborers at the end of the 19th century.
114,"The unmixed indigenous Hawaiian population has still not restored itself to its 300,000 pre-contact level. "
115,"As of 2010, only 156,000 persons declared themselves to be of Native Hawaiian-only ancestry, just over half the pre-contact level Native Hawaiian population, although an additional 371,000 persons declared themselves to possess Native Hawaiian ancestry in combination with one or more other races (including other Polynesian groups, but mostly Asian and/or Caucasian)."
116,"As of 2018, the United States Census Bureau estimates the population of Hawaii at 1,420,491, a decrease of 7,047 from the previous year and an increase of 60,190 (4.42%) since 2010. "
117,"This includes a natural increase of 48,111 (96,028 births minus 47,917 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 16,956 people into the state. "
118,"Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 30,068; migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,112 people."
119,The center of population of Hawaii is located on the island of O'ahu. 
120,"Large numbers of Native Hawaiians have moved to Las Vegas, which has been called the ""ninth island"" of Hawaii.[149][150]"
121,"Hawaii has a de facto population of over 1.4 million, due in part to a large number of military personnel and tourist residents. "
122,"O'ahu is the most populous island; it has the highest population density with a resident population of just under one million in 597 square miles (1,546 km2), approximately 1,650 people per square mile. "
123,"Hawaii's 1.4 million residents, spread across 6,000 square miles (15,500 km2) of land, result in an average population density of 188.6 persons per square mile.[152] "
124,The state has a lower population density than Ohio and Illinois.[153]
125,"The average projected lifespan of people born in Hawaii in 2000 is 79.8 years; 77.1 years if male, 82.5 if female longer than the average lifespan of any other U.S. state.[154] "
126,"As of 2011 the U.S. military reported it had 42,371 personnel on the islands.[155]"
127,"According to the 2020 United States Census, Hawaii had a population of 1,455,271. "
128,The state's population identified as 37.2% Asian; 25.3% Multiracial; 22.9% White; 10.8% Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders; 9.5% Hispanic and Latinos of any race; 1.6% Black or African American; 1.8% from some other race; and 0.3% Native American and Alaskan Native.[156]
129,Hawaii has the highest percentage of Asian Americans and multiracial Americans and the lowest percentage of White Americans of any state. 
130,It is the only state where people who identify as Asian Americans are the largest ethnic group. 
131,"In 2012, 14.5% of the resident population under age 1 was non-Hispanic white.[160]"
132,"Hawaii's Asian population consists mainly of 198,000 (14.6%) Filipino Americans, 185,000 (13.6%) Japanese Americans, roughly 55,000 (4.0%) Chinese Americans, and 24,000 (1.8%) Korean Americans.[161] "
133,"There are more than 80,000 Indigenous Hawaiians 5.9% of the population.[161] "
134,"Including those with partial ancestry, Samoan Americans constitute 2.8% of Hawaii's population, and Tongan Americans constitute 0.6%.[162]"
135,"Over 120,000 (8.8%) Hispanic and Latino Americans live in Hawaii. "
136,"Mexican Americans number over 35,000 (2.6%); Puerto Ricans exceed 44,000 (3.2%). Multiracial Americans constitute almost 25% of Hawaii's population, exceeding 320,000 people. "
137,"Hawaii is the only state to have a tri racial group as its largest multiracial group, one that includes white, Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (22% of all mutiracial population).[163] "
138,"The non-Hispanic White population numbers around 310,000 just over 20% of the population. "
139,"The multi-racial population outnumbers the non Hispanic white population by about 10,000 people.[161] "
140,"In 1970, the Census Bureau reported Hawaii's population was 38.8% white and 57.7% Asian and Pacific Islander.[164]"
141,"The five largest European ancestries in Hawaii are German (7.4%), Irish (5.2%), English (4.6%), Portuguese (4.3%) and Italian (2.7%). "
142,About 82.2% of the state's residents were born in the United States. 
143,Roughly 75% of foreign-born residents originate in Asia. 
144,Hawaii is a majority-minority state. 
145,It was expected to be one of three states that would not have a non-Hispanic white plurality in 2014; the other two are California and New Mexico.[165]
146,The third group of foreigners to arrive in Hawaii were from China. 
147,Chinese workers on Western trading ships settled in Hawaii starting in 1789. 
148,"In 1820, the first American missionaries arrived to preach Christianity and teach the Hawaiians Western ways.[168] "
149,"As of 2015, a large proportion of Hawaii's population have Asian ancestry especially Filipino, Japanese and Chinese. "
150,Many are descendants of immigrants brought to work on the sugarcane plantations in the mid-to-late 19th century. 
151,"The first 153 Japanese immigrants arrived in Hawaii on June 19, 1868. "
152,They were not approved by the then-current Japanese government because the contract was between a broker and the Tokugawa shogunate by then replaced by the Meiji Restoration. 
153,"The first Japanese current-government-approved immigrants arrived on February 9, 1885, after Kal_kaua's petition to Emperor Meiji when Kal_kaua visited Japan in 1881.[169][170]"
154,"Almost 13,000 Portuguese migrants had arrived by 1899; they also worked on the sugarcane plantations.[171] By 1901, more than 5,000 Puerto Ricans were living in Hawaii.[172]"
155,"English and Hawaiian are listed as Hawaii's official languages in the state's 1978 constitution, in Article XV, Section 4.[173] "
156,"However, the use of Hawaiian is limited because the constitution specifies that ""Hawaiian shall be required for public acts and transactions only as provided by law""."
157,"Hawai_i Creole English, locally referred to as ""Pidgin"", is the native language of many native residents and is a second language for many others.[174]"
158,"As of the 2000 Census, 73.4% of Hawaii residents age 5 and older exclusively speak English at home."
159,"[175] According to the 2008 American Community Survey, 74.6% of Hawaii's residents older than 5 speak only English at home."
160,"[166] In their homes, 21.0% of state residents speak an additional Asian language, 2.6% speak Spanish, 1.6% speak other Indo-European languages and 0.2% speak another language.[166]"
161,"After English, other languages popularly spoken in the state are Tagalog, Japanese and Ilocano."
162,"Significant numbers of European immigrants and their descendants also speak their native languages; the most numerous are German, Portuguese, Italian and French."
163,"5.4% of residents speak Tagalog, which includes non-native speakers of Filipino, a Tagalog-based national and co-official language of the Philippines; 5.0% speak Japanese and 4.0% speak Ilocano; 1.2% speak Chinese, 1.7% speak Hawaiian; 1.7% speak Spanish; 1.6% speak Korean; and 1.0% speak Samoan.[175]"
164,"The Hawaiian language has about 2,000 native speakers, about 0.15% of the total population."
165,"[176] According to the United States Census, there were more than 24,000 total speakers of the language in Hawaii in 2006-2008."
166,[177] Hawaiian is a Polynesian member of the Austronesian language family.
167,"[176] It is closely related to other Polynesian languages, such as Marquesan, Tahitian, M_ori, Rapa Nui (the language of Easter Island), and less closely to Samoan and Tongan.[178]"
168,"According to Schutz, the Marquesans colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 CE[179] and were later followed by waves of seafarers from the Society Islands, Samoa and Tonga."
169,[180] These Polynesians remained in the islands; they eventually became the Hawaiian people and their languages evolved into the Hawaiian language.
170,"[181] Kimura and Wilson say, ""[l]inguists agree that Hawaiian is closely related to Eastern Polynesian, with a particularly strong link in the Southern Marquesas, and a secondary link in Tahiti, which may be explained by voyaging between the Hawaiian and Society Islands"".[182]"
171,"Before the arrival of Captain James Cook, the Hawaiian language had no written form."
172,That form was developed mainly by American Protestant missionaries between 1820 and 1826 who assigned to the Hawaiian phonemes letters from the Latin alphabet. 
173,Interest in Hawaiian increased significantly in the late 20th century. 
174,"With the help of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, specially designated immersion schools in which all subjects would be taught in Hawaiian were established. "
175,The University of Hawaii developed a Hawaiian language graduate studies program.
176,Municipal codes were altered to favor Hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments.[183]
177,Hawaiian distinguishes between long and short vowel sounds. 
178,"In modern practice, vowel length is indicated with a macron (kahak_). "
179,Hawaiian-language newspapers (n_pepa) published from 1834 to 1948 and traditional native speakers of Hawaiian generally omit the marks in their own writing. 
180,The _okina and kahak_ are intended to capture the proper pronunciation of Hawaiian words.
181,[184] The Hawaiian language uses the glottal stop (_Okina) as a consonant. 
182,It is written as a symbol similar to the apostrophe or left-hanging (opening) single quotation mark.[185]
183,The keyboard layout used for Hawaiian is QWERTY.[186]
184,"Some residents of Hawaii speak Hawai_i Creole English (HCE), endonymically called pidgin or pidgin English. "
185,"The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog. "
186,"During the 19th century, the increase in immigration mainly from China, Japan, Portugal especially from the Azores and Madeira, and Spain catalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as pidgin. "
187,"By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language. "
188,HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic.
189,"Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ahi."
190,HCE speakers have modified the meanings of some English words. 
191,"For example, ""aunty"" and ""uncle"" may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder. "
192,Syntax and grammar follow distinctive rules different from those of General American English. 
193,"For example, instead of ""it is hot today, isn't it?"", an HCE speaker would say simply ""stay hot, eh?""[h] The term da kine is used as a filler; a substitute for virtually any word or phrase. "
194,"During the surfing boom in Hawaii, HCE was influenced by surfer slang. "
195,"Some HCE expressions, such as brah and da kine, have found their ways elsewhere through surfing communities."
196,"Hawaii is among the most religiously diverse states in the U.S., with one in ten residents practicing a non-Christian faith."
197,"Native Hawaiians continue to engage in traditional religious and spiritual practices today, often adhering to Christian and traditional beliefs at the same time."
198,"Christianity remains the majority religion, mainly represented by various Protestants groups and Roman Catholics. "
199,"The second largest religion is Buddhism, which is concentrated in the Japanese community, and comprises a larger proportion of the population than any other state."
200,"The unaffiliated and nonreligious account for roughly half the population, making Hawaii one of the most secular states."
201,"The Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew in Honolulu was formally the seat of the Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church, a province of the Anglican Communion that had been the state church of the Kingdom of Hawaii; it subsequently merged into the Episcopal Church in the 1890s following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, becoming the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Hawaii. "

208,"The history of Hawaii's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries: sandalwood,[217] whaling,[218] sugarcane, pineapple, the military, tourism and education. "
209,"By the 1840s, sugar plantations had gained a strong foothold in the Hawaiian economy, due to a high demand of sugar in the United States and rapid transport via steamships."
210,"Sugarcane plantations were tightly controlled by American missionary families and businessmen known as ""the Big Five"", who monopolized control of the sugar industry's profits."
211,"By the time Hawaiian annexation was being considered in 1898, sugarcane producers turned to cultivating tropical fruits like pineapple, which became the principal export for Hawai_i's plantation economy."
212,"Since statehood in 1959, tourism has been the largest industry, contributing 24.3% of the gross state product (GSP) in 1997, despite efforts to diversify. "
213,"The state's gross output for 2003 was US$47 billion; per capita income for Hawaii residents in 2014 was US$54,516."
214,Hawaiian exports include food and clothing. 
215,"These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy, due to the shipping distance to viable markets, such as the West Coast of the United States. "
216,"The state's food exports include coffee, macadamia nuts, pineapple, livestock, sugarcane and honey."
217,"By weight, honey bees may be the state's most valuable export."

225,Tax is collected by the Hawaii Department of Taxation.
226,"[227] Most government revenue comes from personal income taxes and a general excise tax (GET) levied primarily on businesses; there is no statewide tax on sales,[228] personal property, or stock transfers,[229] while the effective property tax rate is among the lowest in the country."
227,[230] The high rate of tourism means that millions of visitors generate public revenue through GET and the hotel room tax.
228,"[231] However, Hawaii residents generally pay among the most state taxes per person in the U.S.[231]"
229,"The Tax Foundation of Hawaii considers the state's tax burden too high, claiming that it contributes to higher prices and the perception of an unfriendly business climate."
230,"The nonprofit Tax Foundation ranks Hawaii third in income tax burden and second in its overall tax burden, though notes that a significant portion of taxes are borne by tourists."
231,"[232] Former State Senator Sam Slom attributed Hawaii's comparatively high tax rate to the fact that the state government is responsible for education, health care, and social services that are usually handled at a county or municipal level in most other states.[231]"
232,"The cost of living in Hawaii, specifically Honolulu, is high compared to that of most major U.S. cities, although it is 6.7% lower than in New York City and 3.6% lower than in San Francisco."
233,"[233] These numbers may not take into account some costs, such as increased travel costs for flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the contiguous U.S. While some online stores offer free shipping on orders to Hawaii, many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and certain other U.S. territories.[234][235]"
234,"Hawaiian Electric Industries, a privately owned company, provides 95% of the state's population with electricity, mostly from fossil-fuel power stations. "

239,"The sale price of single family homes in Hawaii was the highest of any U.S. city in 2010, just above that of the Silicon Valley area of California (US$602,000).[238]"
240,Hawaii's very high cost of living is the result of several interwoven factors of the global economy in addition to domestic U.S. government trade policy. 
241,"Like other regions with desirable weather year-round, such as California, Arizona and Florida, Hawaii's residents can be considered to be subject to a ""sunshine tax"". "
242,"This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs, a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well."
243,"The higher costs to ship goods across an ocean may be further increased by the requirements of the Jones Act, which generally requires that goods be transported between places within the U.S., including between the mainland U.S. west coast and Hawaii, using only U.S.-owned, built, and crewed ships. "
244,"Jones Act-compliant vessels are often more expensive to build and operate than foreign equivalents, which can drive up shipping costs. "
245,"While the Jones Act does not affect transportation of goods to Hawaii directly from Asia, this type of trade is nonetheless not common; this is a result of other primarily economic reasons including additional costs associated with stopping over in Hawaii (e.g. pilot and port fees), the market size of Hawaii, and the economics of using ever-larger ships that cannot be handled in Hawaii for transoceanic voyages."
246,"Therefore, Hawaii relies on receiving most inbound goods on Jones Act-qualified vessels originating from the U.S. west coast, which may contribute to the increased cost of some consumer goods and therefore the overall cost of living."
247,[239][240] Critics of the Jones Act contend that Hawaii consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act.[241]

"
